# ProfilePage Improvements Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ **Navbar Overlap Issue**
**Problem**: Text was getting hidden under the navbar
**Solution**: 
- Added proper `pt-20` (top padding) to account for fixed navbar height
- Restructured layout with separate header section and main content area
- Used consistent spacing patterns from other pages

### 2. ✅ **Page Size and Layout Issues**
**Problem**: ProfilePage was too big and didn't match other pages
**Solution**:
- Removed excessive padding and margins
- Used consistent `max-w-7xl mx-auto` container width
- Applied proper spacing with `py-8` for main content
- Made layout consistent with HomePage and ProductsPage patterns

### 3. ✅ **Form Sizing and Design**
**Problem**: Forms were oversized and had extra containers
**Solution**:
- Removed redundant white background containers from forms
- Adjusted form widths: ProfileForm `max-w-4xl`, PasswordForm `max-w-2xl`
- Removed extra padding and margins
- Made forms fit properly within tab content

### 4. ✅ **Design Consistency**
**Problem**: ProfilePage didn't match the design language of other pages
**Solution**:
- Added proper header section with breadcrumb and title
- Used consistent color scheme (tiffany-blue for active tabs)
- Added smooth transitions and animations with Framer Motion
- Applied consistent shadow and border styling

### 5. ✅ **API Field Name Mismatch**
**Problem**: Forms used incorrect field names that didn't match backend API
**Solution**:
- Updated ProfileForm: `firstName` → `first_name`, `lastName` → `last_name`
- Updated PasswordForm: `currentPassword` → `current_password`, etc.
- Fixed all validation and form handling to use correct field names
